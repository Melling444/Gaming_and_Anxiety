# Gaming and Anxiety Cluster and Classification
This is a project that centers around a dataset on Kaggle "Online Gaming Anxiety Data". I am  mostly interested in the largest subset of this data, which is players of the game "league of legends" which I also enjoy.  
The data has 55 columns with numerous missing values and unique categorical values. There will need to be quite a bit of cleaning before we can encode and analyze.  
There is also, notably, not a good target, label variable. After cleaning and encoding, I use hierarchical clustering to add labels and then test the viability of the labels with classification.  
There is still quite a bit to do with the data in the realm of EDA, and I am looking forward to doing that over my next few commits to the git repository.
